Retruate.Languages
==================

This repository contains projects and documentation for **Aware** language and **D#**.

I am learning language design and compilers, so as such, this repository serves as both source files and a scratch pad for language ideas and compiler tests.

Ideally, this repository could host shared infrastructure and tooling for both languages, similar to dotnet/roslyn, though the comparison only serves as goal as neither client language even exists yet.
