DSharp
======

A step between C# and F# :)

This language first and foremost is a toy language - the "Sharp" does not mean to imbue this project with any relevance with respect to the .NET ecosystem. The name comes from the fact that my "dream" language borrows features from F# without going fully functional, though I do intend for the first target for this language to be IL.
